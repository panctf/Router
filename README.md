# Router
## Netgear AC1000 Analysis
### Basic Access
The usual interaction with the router is done through the web portal at www.routerlogin.com

By going to the url www.routerlogin.com/setup.cgi?todo=debug it will open a telnet service on port 23 to connect to. Logging in with the same login as the routerlogin gives shell access to the router.

Currently working on analysis of the various processes running on the router.
